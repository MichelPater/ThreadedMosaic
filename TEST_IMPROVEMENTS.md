# Test Coverage Improvement Tasks

## Status Legend
- ❌ **TODO** - Not started
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Currently working on
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Finished and verified

---

## **🎯 High Priority - Core Algorithm Testing**

### 1. Mosaic.CreateMosaic Method Coverage
- ❌ Test with 1x1, 2x2, and large grid configurations
- ❌ Test with null/empty tileColors array
- ❌ Test with mismatched graphics context and tile dimensions
- ❌ Test memory cleanup during mosaic generation

### 2. GetColorTilesFromBitmap Edge Cases
- ❌ Test with 1x1 pixel images
- ❌ Test with images that don't divide evenly into tiles
- ❌ Test with images containing pure black/white/transparent pixels
- ❌ Test with high-contrast gradient images

### 3. CreateSizeAppropriateRectangle Boundary Testing
- ❌ Test with coordinates at exact grid boundaries
- ❌ Test with remainder pixels in both dimensions
- ❌ Test with tiles larger than the source image
- ❌ Test edge tiles vs interior tiles have correct dimensions

---

## **🔧 PhotoMosaic Specific Coverage**

### 4. PhotoMosaic.BuildImage Integration
- ❌ Test actual image drawing vs expected colors
- ❌ Test transparency overlay application
- ❌ Test resource disposal after image operations
- ❌ Test with various tile sizes and image ratios

### 5. GetClosestMatchingImage Algorithm Accuracy
- ❌ Test color matching precision with known color sets
- ❌ Test with identical colors (should return first match)
- ❌ Test with grayscale vs color images
- ❌ Test fallback behavior with empty image collections

### 6. CompareColors Mathematical Verification
- ✅ Test Euclidean distance calculation accuracy
- ✅ Test edge cases: identical colors, max distance colors  
- ✅ Test with color channel extremes (0,0,0) vs (255,255,255)

---

## **🎨 HueMosaic Specific Coverage**

### 7. HueMosaic.BuildImage Overlay Logic
- ❌ Test transparency calculation (FromArgb(210, R, G, B))
- ❌ Test image-over-color composite rendering
- ❌ Test random image selection impact on output

### 8. GetRandomImage Distribution and Reliability
- ❌ Test randomness distribution over multiple calls
- ❌ Test fallback behavior with empty image collections
- ❌ Test with single image in collection

---

## **🌈 ColorMosaic Coverage**

### 9. ColorMosaic.BuildImage Solid Color Logic
- ❌ Test accurate color reproduction
- ❌ Test with extreme colors (pure RGB, black, white)
- ❌ Test brush disposal and resource management

---

## **⚡ Performance and Concurrency**

### 10. Thread Safety Testing
- ❌ Test concurrent mosaic creation
- ❌ Test shared resource access patterns
- ❌ Test progress reporting under concurrent load

### 11. Memory and Resource Management
- ❌ Test bitmap disposal in GetAverageColor
- ❌ Test Graphics object cleanup in CreateMosaic
- ❌ Test large image handling without memory leaks

### 12. Performance Boundary Testing
- ❌ Test with images requiring >1000 tiles
- ❌ Test with very small tile sizes (1x1, 2x2)
- ❌ Test processing time with large image collections

---

## **💡 Testability Improvements (Minimal Code Changes)**

### 13. Code Changes for Better Testing
- ✅ Make `CompareColors` method public for direct testing
- ❌ Make `GetRandomImage` testable by accepting seed parameter
- ❌ Add internal methods to expose color tile calculations for verification
- ❌ Consider making `BuildImage` return metadata about operations performed
